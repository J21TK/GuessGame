# Introduction
## GuessGame
You can try to guess the secret number this program has.

## GuessGame_2 and Variations
Same as GuessGame, but this is simulator (You cannot play the game).
GuessGame_2 includes the fundamental functions,
and Variations includes some developped codes (inherited from GuessGame_2).
All of the results with this simulator are in the "results" directory.

## GuessGame_3
This is the opposite game of GuessGame;
You have a secret number, and this program try to guess it.


# results directory
## IndividualGraph
This code will read all of the .txt files in the same directory, and make a graph per one text file.
The graph shows how many trials are required to guess a certain secret number.
(x: the answer of secret number, y: No. of trial)
Pandas, numpy, and matplotlib libraries are required

## Statistics
This code will read all of the .txt files in the same directory, and make a summary graph of how many trials are required to guess the secret number whichever it is.
Pandas, numpy, and matplotlib libraries are required
